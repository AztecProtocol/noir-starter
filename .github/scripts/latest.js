  /**
   * TODO: test the prerelease!
   *
   * The problem with the prerelease is that if the test runs for both the stable and the prerelease,
   * and the prerelease has a breaking change, then the stable will fail.
   *
   * If we update the starter to match the prerelease, then the stable will fail.
   *
   * This means that if there is a breaking change in a prerelease, we will ALWAYS get a warning ðŸ˜„, which defeats the purpose.
   *
   * A solution would be to have a separate "prerelease" branch that is updated with the prerelease. And the CI runs on that branch.
   * However, Noir hasn't yet reached a state where, for example, there is ALWAYS a prerelease newer than the stable.
   * Sometimes the stable is the last one, and there is a prerelease buried somewhere that never got the honor of being promoted to stable.
   *
   * So for now, we will just ignore the prerelease.
